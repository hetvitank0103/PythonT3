    "explanation:This problem aims to identify teams that, despite having a successful season in terms of wins and losses, were still collectively outperformed by their opponents in scoring. A team qualifies for this category if it has a winning record (i.e., the number of games won is greater than the number of games lost) while also being collectively outscored, meaning the total points scored by the team across all games are less than the total points scored against them. This situation highlights teams that win more matches overall but often lose by large margins or win by narrow ones, leading to a paradox where their total points fall short of their opponents' totals.
